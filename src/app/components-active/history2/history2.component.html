      I was a software engineer at DBS Bank (Singapore) focusing on enterprise finance software. In my tenure, I have specialised in full-stack engineering, data visualisation, quality assurance, and most recently, UX design and development. 
      <br><br>
      I was the Principal Developer of the leading bank-wide enterprise UI component library. You may catch a glimpse of this library

      <a href="https://www.parabola.unsw.edu.au/content/about-us" target="_blank">Parabola</a> is a recreational math magazine published by the University of New South Wales since 1964. Having an article published by Parabola remains one of my proudest academic accomplishments. 
      <br><br>
      The article is titled "Prime Numbers Generated From Highly Composite Numbers" and you may read it <a href="https://www.parabola.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/2024-03/vol54_no3_4.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

      I am currently working on another Number Theory paper which has since gotten favourable reviews. I'm hoping to publish this in the near future, but <a href="assets/Benny_Twin_Prime.pdf" download="On the Infinitude of Twin Primes - Benny Lim.pdf">here's a draft</a> for any curious readers.

      Owing to the Singaporean education system, I've received a particularly STEM focused education my whole life, not that I'm complaining. I've enjoyed and excelled in Physics and Math particularly, and went on to pursue a degree in Physics from the National University of Singapore, where I'd also picked up Computer Science.
      <br><br>
      Later in my career, I hope to combine my knowledge in STEM and skills in UX engineering to be an effective science communicator. To that end, I have built a showcase of a physics lesson in "Everyday Electricity" <a routerLink="/physics">here</a>. 
      <br><br>
      The <a routerLink="/gravity-sim">gravity simulator</a> that I'm currently building is another showcase of the marriage between my physics and UX background.

      Despite my STEM-y education, I've actively incorporated artsy hobbies in my life - these include 3D modelling, 3D printing, UX design, cartooning, baking, and playing the piano since childhood. 
      <br><br>
      I have over 7700 hours of play time on just one particular video game, Dota 2 - make of that what you will.
      <br><br>
      As for sports and outdoorsy activities, I enjoy badminton, cycling, kayaking, billiards, and a nice walk in the park.

      Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
