    This is an animation of a revolutionary train system which I designed myself ðŸ™ƒ.
    <br><br>
    The extraordinary efficiency is achieved through:
    <ol>
      <li>Effectively always maintaining trains going at full speed, saving all that unnecessary decelerating and accelerating.</li>
      <li>Arrivals: Decoupling then decelerating <b>only the end carriages</b>.</li>
      <li>Departures: Accelerating carriages to couple with the <b>front</b> of the incoming train.</li>
      <li>Passengers always board the front carriages, then move to carriages with pre-defined stops.</li>
      <li>Train stations with custom carriage capacities to accomodate variable traffic.</li>
    </ol>
    I plan to enhance the simulation and do some concrete statistical analysis based on the Singapore MRT system. Stay tuned! ðŸ‘€
